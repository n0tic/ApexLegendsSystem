# Apex-Legends-System 
As a personal challenge. I set out to create a system which handles the same way as Apex Legends.

 NOTE: THIS IS NOT A GAME. JUST A REPLICATED DEMO SYSTEM.

 ***How does Apex Legends system work?***
- Players start with no armor or helmet. Only 100 HP.
- Players can equip gear and use items.
- Players stats will be affected by the items and gear.
  - White armor = 2 bars, blue armor = 3 bars, purple & gold armor = 4 bars of shields.
    - Each bar is 25 armor. Gold grade armor has a bonus stats and increase the usage speed of items by 25%.
- If a player gets shot and has no armor the damage be directly to the health.
- If a player gets shot and has armor the damage would be taken directly from the shield.
  - If any damage would remain it will then damage the health of that player.
  
 ***What is in this repository?***
 
 What I included in this project was the basic functionality of the Apex Legends system.
 You can chose diffrent type of armor and helmet to equip.
 You can damage the player -15 each time you press the big red button.
 You can use various items that is in the game to recover your player.
 The gold tier armor gives a 25% decrease in item usage time.
